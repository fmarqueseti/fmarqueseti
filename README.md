## About Me

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in developing software solutions across desktop, web, and mobile platforms, as well as projects involving mainframe environments. With a strong academic background in Information Technology and multiple specializations, I operate with fluency in both technical development and technical education and training.

My main differentiators are technological versatility and methodological adaptability, combined with the ability to contribute in multiple roles—whether as a backend developer, software architect, or instructor. My career spans impactful contributions in both corporate and academic settings, with a focus on Delphi, COBOL, PHP, and integrations with various relational database systems.

I am currently the founder of [Main Focus](http://mainfocus.com.br), a company specialized in custom software solutions, contributing to the modernization and continuous improvement of enterprise platforms.
